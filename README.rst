Jancy
=====

Abstract
--------

Jancy is a **scripting programming language** with the **LLVM** back-end. Jancy offers a lot of convenient features for low-level IO (input-output) and UI (user-interface) programming which are not found in mainstream languages (and sometimes, nowhere else). This includes **safe pointer** arithmetics, high level of source-level and ABI **compatibility with C**, **reactive programming**, built-in generator of **incremental lexers/scanners** and a lot more.

Design Principles
-----------------

* Object-oriented scripting language for IO and UI programming with C-family syntax
* ABI (application-binary-interface) compatibility with C
* Automatic memory management via accurate GC (garbage collection)
* LLVM (Low Level Virtual Machine) as a back-end

Key Features
------------

* Safe pointers and pointer arithmetic
* Unprecedented for scripting languages source-level compatibility with C
* Built-in Reactive Programming support
* Built-in regexp-based generator of incremental lexers/scanners
* Deterministic resource release
* Error handling model which allows both throw-catch semantics and error code checks -- with the same function!

Other Notable Features
----------------------

* Properties (the most comprehensive implementation thereof)
* Multicasts and events (including weak events, which do not require to unsubscribe)
* Multiple inheritance
* Const-correctness
* Thread local storage
* Weak pointers (do not retain objects)
* Partial application for functions and properties
* Scheduled function pointers
* Bitflag enums
* Perl-style formatting
* Hexadimal, binary and multi-line literals
